# MidTerm1

Write a program in C 
- First function (10%): Store length of array (n<100) and array elements (integer)
- Second function (10%): Print array
- 3rd function (task 1 - 20%): Print the min and max of the array
- 4th function (task 2 - 20%): Print the mean of the array
- 5th function (task 4 - 20%): Print the the second smallest element in an array
- 6th function (task 5 - 20%): Print the longest continuest increasing sub-array.

Do not modify main function
Example

n= 10

2 8 5 5 6 7 9 10 4 7
- Task = 1
-- Max = 10, Min = 2,
- Task = 2
-- Mean = 6.3
- Task = 3
-- Second Smallest = 4
- Task = 4
-- Longest continuest increasing sub-array : 5 6 7 9 10

**Your code will also be grading manually, the automatic grading is not the final results**
